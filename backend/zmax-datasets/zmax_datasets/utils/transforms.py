    Apply FIR filter with a Hamming window. The filter length is automatically

        data (np.ndarray): The input data to be filtered, shape (..., n_samples).
        sampling_frequency (float): The sampling frequency of the input data in Hz.
        low_cutoff (float, optional): The lower frequency bound of
           the bandpass filter in Hz.
           If None, a highpass filter is applied. Default is None.
        high_cutoff (float, optional): The upper frequency bound of
           the bandpass filter in Hz.
           If None, a lowpass filter is applied. Default is None.

        If `low_cutoff` is greater than `high_cutoff`, a bandstop filter is applied.
        If `low_cutoff` is less than `high_cutoff`, a bandpass filter is applied.
